Soft Shadow Image Generation Using Maya
=======================================
This repository contains a script to generate training images for our ToG 2015 paper "Learning to Remove Soft Shadows". You will need Maya and [PyMel](http://help.autodesk.com/cloudhelp/2015/ENU/Maya-Tech-Docs/PyMel/) to run this.

Please note: this code a little rusty - I have not used it for a while and do not currently have Maya installed to check if everything works. If you know how to make it better, or spot bugs, please let me know - I'll happily accept any contributions.
